.SYNOPSIS
    Installation script for the Rusty Kaspa environment.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the setup of the necessary development environment for Rusty Kaspa.
    It installs and configures Git, Protocol Buffers, LLVM, Rust toolchain, and wasm-pack.
    Additionally, it prepares the system to build and run the Kaspa node.

    Default installation directory is 'C:\KaspaNode'. This directory or the one specified by -rootFolder
    will be used as the root for all installations. Use the -rootFolder parameter to specify a different location.
    
    Example: PS> .\installation_script.ps1 -rootFolder "D:\MyKaspaNode"

    A batch file named 'rustyKaspa.bat' is created in the root folder for easy startup of the Kaspa node.
    To run the node, navigate to the root folder, right-click 'rustyKaspa.bat', and select 'Run as administrator'.
    This ensures all necessary permissions are available for node operation.

    If errors occur during script execution, refer to 'installation_log.txt' in the root folder for detailed logs
    and error messages that can assist in troubleshooting.
